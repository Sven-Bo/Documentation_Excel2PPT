# Can I view and edit the VBA code?

**Yes,** you can view, modify, and extend the VBA code to suit your needs. To access the code in Excel:

1. **Press `Alt + F11`** to open the **VBA Editor**.
2. In the VBA Editor, navigate to **Project Explorer** (if itâ€™s not visible, press `Ctrl + R`).
3. Look for **Excel2PPT** in the list, expand it, and select the modules where the VBA code is stored.

You can then make any edits or customizations directly in the VBA Editor.
