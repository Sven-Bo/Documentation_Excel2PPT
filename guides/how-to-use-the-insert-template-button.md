# How to Use the Insert Template Button

The **Insert Template Button** in Excel2PPT makes it easy to inject the tool into any existing workbook. This is particularly useful if you want to reuse Excel2PPTâ€™s functionality in your own spreadsheets without having to recreate everything from scratch.

#### Steps to Use the Insert Template Button

1. **Open the Excel2PPT Tool**
   * Open the Excel workbook that contains the Excel2PPT tool. This is where the button to insert the template is located.
2. **Click on the Insert Template Button**
   * Locate and click on the button labeled **Insert Template**. This will start the process of copying all necessary macros and sheets to your target workbook.
3. **Select the Workbook to Insert the Template**
   * After clicking the button, you will be prompted to select a workbook where you want to insert the template.
   * Navigate to the folder where your target workbook is saved, select it, and click **Open**.
4. **Macro-Enabled Workbook Creation**
   * The tool will automatically copy all the relevant VBA modules and forms into your target workbook.
   * A new version of the workbook will be saved as a macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm). This ensures all macros function correctly, while your original workbook remains unchanged.
5. **Verify the New Workbook**
   * The new workbook will be automatically opened after the process completes. You can verify that all data and settings have been correctly transferred.
   * Notice that your original workbook will remain intact, with no changes made, and you will have a new version that now includes all the Excel2PPT capabilities.

#### Important Tips

* **File Format**: The new workbook will be saved as a macro-enabled workbook, with a file extension of **.xlsm**.
* **Preserve Original Workbook**: The original workbook will not be modified. Only the copy will have the Excel2PPT functionality.
