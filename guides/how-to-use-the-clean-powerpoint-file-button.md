# How to Use the Clean PowerPoint File Button

The **Clean PowerPoint File** feature in Excel2PPT allows you to quickly remove shapes and images previously inserted using the tool. This is especially helpful if you've exported charts and ranges from Excel, made additional edits to the PowerPoint (like adding comments or other elements), and then realize you need to update the presentation with new data. Instead of manually deleting all the images, you can use this feature to remove them in one go, making the presentation ready for fresh content.

#### Steps to Clean a PowerPoint File

1. **Click the Clean PowerPoint File Button**
   * In the Excel2PPT workbook, click the button labeled **Clean PowerPoint File**.
2. **Confirm the Action**
   * A message box will ask you to confirm the cleaning action. Click **Yes** to proceed.
3. **Select the PowerPoint File to Clean**
   * You will be prompted to select the PowerPoint file to clean.
   * Navigate to the correct folder, select your file, and the tool will start the cleaning process.
4. **Review the Cleaned Presentation**
   * Once the tool finishes, a new version of the PowerPoint presentation will be saved with `_cleaned` added to the filename to avoid overwriting your original file.
   * Open the cleaned presentation to verify that all images and shapes added by Excel2PPT have been removed.
